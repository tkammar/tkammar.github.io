# Data Visualization Portfolio – Tala Kammar

This portfolio showcases a collection of data visualizations developed during my graduate studies at Georgetown University (PPOL 6802 – Data Visualization). 
The visuals span demographic analysis, migration patterns, labor statistics, and global health indicators—designed for policy storytelling and analytical clarity.

## Contents (PDF Visuals)

Each visual applies best practices in the Grammar of Graphics, accessibility, and narrative design for a policy audience. PDFs are located in the `/pdf` folder.

|   Title | Description |
|---------|----------------|
| **Dependency Ratios by Income Group (2000–2024)** | Multi-facet line chart with direct end-of-line labels to reduce legend fatigue and highlight aging disparities across income levels |
| **Fertility vs. Life Expectancy** | Bubble chart showing demographic transition stages for 200+ countries; bubbles scaled logarithmically and color-coded by region |
| **Net Displacement in Syria (2011–2025)** | Choropleth-style Mapbox dashboard showing Aleppo's net population loss of –2.5M using a divergent color ramp |
| **Global Heatmaps & Choropleths** | Visuals with color-blind-safe palettes and annotation layers to improve accessibility and data storytelling |
| **U.S. Crime, H-1B LCA, and UN Population Trends** | A set of comparative visuals using chained tidyverse transforms (pivot_longer → mutate → pivot_wider) for time-series and geospatial data |

## About This Work
This portfolio emphasizes **exploratory vs. explanatory storytelling**, **reproducible workflows**, and **ethical visual design**. All code was written in R Markdown and exported as PDF/HTML reports. Annotation, sourcing, and reproducibility practices were applied throughout.
